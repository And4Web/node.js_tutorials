important methods:
(1)read file:
  fs.readFile()
(2)using unlink from fs/promises or fs.unlink() to delete a file:
  fs.unlink()
(3)read files in a directory:
  fs.readdir()
(4)write to a file:
  fs.writeFile()
(5)reading a file into a buffer using streams:
  fs.createReadStream()
(6)copy files by piping streams:
  readable = fs.createReadStream()
  writable = fs.createWriteStream()
  readable.pipe(writable);
(7)Open a File:
  fs.open(path, flags, mode, callback)
(8)Reading a File:
  fs.read(fd, buffer, offset, length, position, callback)
(9)Appending to a File:
  fs.appendFile(filepath, data, options, callback)
(10)Closing the File:
  fs.close(fd, callback)
(11)Delete a File:
  fs.unlink(path, callback)
(12)test whether the given path exists or not in the file system:
  fs.exists( path, callback )
(13)create a directory asynchronously:
  fs.mkdir(path, mode, callback)
(14)change the size of the file i.e either increase or decrease the file size. This method changes the length of the file at the path by len bytes:
  fs.truncate( path, len, callback )
(15)synchronously rename a file at the given old path to the given new path:
  fs.renameSync( oldPath, newPath )
(16)delete a directory at the given path:
  fs.rmdir( path, options, callback )
(17)return information about the given file or directory:
  fs.stat( path, options, callback )
(18)
